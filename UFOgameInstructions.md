# UFO alien abduction game 

## 

Have you ever played the word guessing game hangman but was a little uncomfortable with the outcome if you lose? Let's change it up a bit and bring in some good old fashioned alien abductions. 

This is a word guessing game with an alien twist. If you guess an incorrect letter of a word, then the hypothetical person gets closer and closer to getting sucked up into a spaceship. 

The following drawing illustrates where you will start before the person potentially will be abducted.





  
              .-\"^\"-.
             /_....._\\
         .-\"`         `\"-.
        (  ooo  ooo  ooo  )
         '-.,_________,.-'
              /     \\
             /       \\
            /    O    \\
           /   --|--   \\
          /      |      \\
         /      / \\      \\

As you guess incorrectly, the person gets closer to the spaceship:

    .
                 |
              .-\"^\"-.
             /_....._\\
         .-\"`         `\"-.
        (  ooo  ooo  ooo  )
         '-.,_________,.-'
              /--|--\\
             /   |   \\
            /   / \\   \\
           /           \\
          /             \\
         /               \\

How to play:
1. Run the code (in Python) and at the prompt guess a letter and press enter.
2. If you guess correctly, the dashes that represent the word will be replaced by the correct letter. 
3. If you guess incorrectly, the person gets closer to the spaceship. But don’t worry, the incorrect guesses are listed and you have a total of six tries.
4. The game ends when you either guess all the letters correctly and complete the word or you run out of lives and your person is abducted by aliens.
5. But wait, there is more! You can play an unlimited amount of times and the program will keep picking new random words for you to try again. Just type in either Y (for yes) or if you are finished, type N (for no) and the game will stop.
6. If you are in the middle of the game and panic and do not want to go any further, you can always type in a period (“ . ”), and the game will stop. 
7. Have fun!

Rules/information:
- All the words are real words (in English) and chosen from a text file.
- Each word is chosen randomly.
- When the game starts (and restarts), the person starts at the bottom of the alien’s beam.
- You have six incorrect tries and each incorrect letter is listed to help remind you.
- If you think you know the word, go ahead and type it out. You only loss one life if you are incorrect.
